# Java Online Quiz App

A simple console-based quiz application built using Java.  
This project is part of the **Java Developer Internship – Task 8 (Mini Project)**.

---

## Objective

To create a console quiz app that:
- Displays a set of Java-related questions.
- Accepts user answers.
- Calculates and displays the final score.

This project demonstrates understanding of loops, logic, and collections in Java.

---

## Features

- Multiple-choice questions (MCQs)  
- Score calculation based on correct answers  
- Console-based user interaction  
- Uses Java Collections (`ArrayList`)  
- Easily extendable to include more questions  

---

## Concepts Used

- **Loops** – to iterate through questions  
- **If-Else Statements** – to validate answers  
- **ArrayList** – to store question objects  
- **Classes and Objects** – to organize quiz data  
- **Scanner** – to take user input from the console  

---

## How It Works

1. The quiz displays one question at a time.  
2. The user selects an answer (1–4).  
3. The app checks if the answer is correct and updates the score.  
4. After all questions, the final score is shown.
